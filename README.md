## DDGUI
A graphical interface for the good old dd command in a **rooted** Android environment

DD GUI is a free and open source software (FOSS) whose objective is to facilitate the execution of dd commands by providing a graphical interface. Read more about dd here.

To quickly summarize what can be done with this command, here is a list:
- Backup current system/kernel/recovery/[...] image to anywhere
- Directly flash a new recovery/kernel (if recovery partition is known and it is a .img file)
- Copy/replace files as root
